# Face Recognition System

## Project Overview
This Face Recognition System project implements a facial identification and classification solution using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It is designed mainly for recognizing student faces, providing practical experience in machine learning techniques with real-world applications such as security and surveillance.

## Features
- Dataset creation with diverse student face images covering various poses, expressions, and lighting conditions.
- Image preprocessing: face alignment, resizing, and normalization.
- Face feature extraction for robust classification.
- KNN model training and hyperparameter tuning.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation.
- Deployment-ready system for real-world face recognition tasks.

## Technology Stack
